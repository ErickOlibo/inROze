# inROze app - Follow Your Music
## Available at the app store

APP Store:

1. Sole iOS developer, from ideation to the initial release at the App Store. Designing the UI/UX, coding the iPhone app, and developing the Rest API web service needed to feed content to the users.

2. inROze provides a simple way to stay up-to-date with your favorite local deejay’s upcoming gigs and mix-tapes.

3. Due to the Cambridge Analytica debacle and Facebook new ‘Terms of Use’ and ‘Privacy Policy’ updates, the service has been halted for the time being.

4. The code has not been updated for  some times, and the code quality, design patterns are quite questionable...
